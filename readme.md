## Introduction

The "University Database Analysis Project" is designed to evaluate proficiency in SQL, database creation, restoration, data analysis, and result reporting. The project allows flexibility in choosing any database for analysis. The examples and tasks are based on a hypothetical university database named "UniversityDB."

I am using **Microsoft SQL Server** database, but feel free to substitute it with a database of your choice.

## Database Creation or Restoration

### a. Create a new database:

- Create a new database using the SQL commands in **creation.sql** file in **sql** directory.

- Use the SQL commands in **insertion.sql** file in **sql** directory to insert some dummy data to get started.

### b. Restore an existing database:

- Use the **backup.sql** file in **backup** directory to restore the database using the **UniversityDB.bak** file. 

## Data Analysis

### a. Count of Students by Department:

- Input: 

        -- Count of Students by Department
        SELECT
            DepartmentName,
            COUNT(*) AS StudentCount
        FROM Students
        JOIN Departments ON Students.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID
        GROUP BY DepartmentName;

- Output:
        
        DepartmentName      StudentCount
        Computer Science         2
        Mathematics              2
        Physics                  2

### b. Total Enrollment by Year:

- Input: 

        -- Total Enrollment by Year
        SELECT
            Year AS AcademicYear,

            AVG(NumericGrade) AS AverageNumericGrade
        FROM Enrollments
        GROUP BY Year;

- Output:

        AcademicYear    TotalEnrollment     AverageNumericGrade

## Result Reports with Charts or Graphs

### a. Data Visualization:

Using PowerBI, the database is connected so graphs and diagrams are generated to visualize the data.

In **visuals** directory a **dataVisualization.pbix** file is present and contains multiple graphs to show data visually to be more live and analytic.

**You can fill in the specific SQL scripts and details based on your implementation. If you encounter any challenges or specific points you want to highlight, include them in the documentation.**
